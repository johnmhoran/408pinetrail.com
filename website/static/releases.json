This is done using a\r\n  2-character Markov chain. A new CLI command,\r\n  ``scancode-train-gibberish-model``, has been added to regenerate the model\r\n  used by the detector.\r\n  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/pull/4610\r\n

Enable License References table for HTML Output without requiring\r\n  `--license-references` by implementing a fallback license reference\r\n  collection based on the behavior of v32.0.0.\r\n  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/pull/4474\r\n  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/issues/4101\r\n\r\n- Replace unmaintained ``toml`` library with ``tomllib`` / ``tomli``.\r\n  https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode-toolkit/issues/4532\r\n\r\n- Pin fingerprints and normality to avoid pyicu\r\n
